    """
    Finds a fixed point of func(x) using a variation of Brent's method.
    The goal is to find f(x) = x, or g(x) = f(x) - x = 0.
    
    NOTE: This is an extensive and complex implementation of a numerical root-finding
    algorithm. The conversion attempts to match the vectorization and logic 
    of the MATLAB code, which operates on multiple independent problems in parallel 
    (one for each element of x0 and the returned vectors). This often requires careful
    handling of boolean masks and array slicing in NumPy.

    :param func: A function that takes x and returns (g(x), f(x)).
    :param x0: The initial guess for x. Can be a scalar or a numpy array.
    :param corner: An optional known 'edge' in the function.
    :param tolFn: Tolerance in y (distance from the fixed point). Defaults to epsilon.
    :param verbose: Boolean for printing status.
    :return: (b, err2, fcounter) - The fixed point, its error, and function calls.
